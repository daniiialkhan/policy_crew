Comprehensive Cover insurance is a type of insurance that protects against accidents, natural calamities, theft, and other unfortunate events. It includes Own Damage Cover which covers damages caused to your own insured vehicle only and not third-party vehicles. Anti-theft devices can be installed to prevent vehicle theft. There are additional covers like Zero Depreciation Add-on and Roadside Assistance Add-on, which cannot be purchased as standalone covers. Outstation Emergency Add-on Cover is useful during an outstation trip and provides a fixed amount to cover accidents, breakdowns, or vehicle immobilization outside a radius of 100 km from your place of residence.
