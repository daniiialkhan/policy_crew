YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a popular way to detect objects in photos and videos. It's faster than other methods because it predicts what the objects are and where they are in one step. There have been improvements to YOLO over the years to make it work even better. The latest version, YOLO11, has some new features that make it really good at finding small or hard to see objects, even in tough conditions. It's useful for things like smart transportation, self-driving cars, and security cameras. Overall, YOLO11 is a big step forward in making object detection more accurate and faster.
