YOLO is not a common term in vehicle insurance. However, there are various terms used in vehicle insurance plans that can be understood quite easily. For instance, OD Cover insures a vehicle against damages caused by accidents, fire, natural/man-made calamities, and theft. Then, there is Outstation Emergency Add-on Cover, which provides assistance if a vehicle is immobilized or meets with an accident at a distance of more than 100 kilometers away from one's residence. First Notification of Loss (FNOL) refers to the early reporting of damage to an insured vehicle or an accident to the insurance company, initiating FNOL swiftly is crucial to avoid claim rejection. Moreover, it is important to know that car insurance premiums entirely depend on the coverage chosen and decrease when a vehicle has safety features that reduce the risk of theft.
