YOLO stands for You Only Look Once, which is a deep learning tool used for detecting vehicles. The latest version of YOLO, called YOLO11, has made significant improvements in terms of the speed, accuracy, and ability to detect objects in complex environments. YOLO11 is capable of detecting a variety of vehicle types, including cars, trucks, buses, motorcycles, and bicycles, and it can efficiently handle challenging environmental conditions. 

This deep learning algorithm excels in high-speed inference, real-time object recognition, and it accurately identifies a wide range of vehicles. As a result, YOLO11 has enormous potential for various real-world systems that require high-speed and accurate object detection. These systems include autonomous driving systems, smart traffic systems, renewable energy systems, urban surveillance, and IoT sensor networks.
