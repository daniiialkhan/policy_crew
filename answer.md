Blanket coverage is a type of insurance that covers more than one location, type of property or employee under a single policy. It is useful for businesses or individuals who have multiple properties or assets to insure as it provides a comprehensive coverage for all the assets. For instance, a business with multiple offices or properties can insure all its properties under one policy through blanket coverage instead of having separate insurance policies for each location.
