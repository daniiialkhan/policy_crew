A policyholder is a person who has bought an insurance policy and is protected by it. Insurance companies may give certain benefits, repay premiums, and dividends to policyholders if they make a profit. Policyholders who are part of a mutual insurance company may receive dividends if there are excess earnings, which means they get a portion of the company's profits. The incontestability provision and incurred but not reported (IBNR) are related concepts to policyholders in the insurance industry. Additionally, there are other types of insurances such as health and homeowners insurance available.
